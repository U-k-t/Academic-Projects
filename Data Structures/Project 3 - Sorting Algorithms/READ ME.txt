Sort.java by Jacob Rothman

Launch the executable jar files as you see fit; I personally recommend using a Linux terminal.

Upon Execution, the Program will Run Different Sorting Methods (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Selection, Quick) on randomly Generated Data Sets. 
To change the size of the data sets, access the switch cases on lines 28,32,36,40, and 44 or add a new switch case.
If adding new switch case, change MAXTESTS on line 10 to represent the number of cases.

The program will cycle through each data set for each sorting method until each method has sorted each set. Times are recorded and printed in console.
